about_content: |
  Founded in Fall 2025, PETAL is NYU's only club dedicated to the exploring the intersection of policy, ethics, tech, accountability, and law. In fact, that's where our name comes from! We value interdisciplinary perspectives and have members across 6+ NYU graduate and undergraduate schools. Our mission is to spread awareness about the ways different disciplines can work together to solve issues in tech policy, and to create a space for mentorship, collaboration, and learning. We have hosted speaker events and interdisciplinary workshops, and also run a research and writing program.

  Our past collaborators include the Engelberg Center for Innovation Policy at NYU Law, the Center for Social Media and Politics, and Tech Policy Press.
